Story:
Once upon a time there was guy in a BMW.
His name was Ralph and everywhere he went he always wore his fancy lederhose.
He was headed to the Flughafen.
He always brought his dog to the Biergarten.
At the Biergarten, he fed his dog a bratwurst.
He loved looking at the Schloss in the distance.
Him and his dog love Rammstein, they listen to them all the time. 
When it became sunset, the BMW broke down at the Schloss Eltz.
So with his BMW broken down, all Ralph could do was sit and eat his apfelkuchen.
Ralph was so hot and fainted because there was no klimaanlage to be found nearby.
When Ralph awoke, he found himself alone in Eltz, with the shadowy figure of Queen Mehlhase watching over him.
