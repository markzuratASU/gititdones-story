Story:
Once upon a time there was guy in a BMW.
His name was Ralph and everywhere he went he always wore his fancy lederhose.
He was headed to the Flughafen.
He always brought his dog to the Biergarten.
At the Biergarten, he fed his dog a bratwurst.
He loved looking at the Schloss in the distance.
Him and his dog love Rammstein, they listen to them all the time. 
When it became sunset, the BMW broke down at the Schloss Eltz.
